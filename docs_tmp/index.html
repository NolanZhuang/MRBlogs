	<div class="entry__content"><h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the scenario, the user starts in a <strong>ground view</strong> with the nearby environment visible. At some point, they want to see something far away, so they need to move to a <strong>sky view</strong> (a higher vantage point) to observe a larger area. A key constraint in this scenario is that <strong>the movement is passive</strong>: the system moves the user rather than the user actively walking/joysticking.</p>
<p>This is an interesting locomotion problem in VR because passive motion can easily increase discomfort and reduce spatial understanding. The slides propose three techniques to handle this “ground → sky” transition, each with different trade-offs.</p></div>

	<div class="entry__content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This blog introduces my locomotion technique idea  which is called <strong>Rhythmic Skateboarding</strong>. It introduces a VR locomotion method that combines rhythm, spatial markers, and embodied interaction to create an engaging movement experience while reducing motion sickness.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-core-mechanism">1. Core Mechanism</h2>
<p>The core idea of Rhythmic Skateboarding is to turn locomotion into an <strong>active, rhythm-driven process</strong> rather than a passive one.</p>
<p>Key principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user always moves forward along the center of the route</li>
<li><strong>Movement speed gradually decreases if the user takes no action</strong></li>
<li>Multiple <strong>markers</strong> are placed along the path</li>
<li>When the user enters a marker’s effective range and performs the corresponding action:
<ul>
<li>Speed increases</li>
<li>Additional effects may be triggered, such as steering, jumping, or body tilting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This design encourages continuous engagement and makes movement feel intentional and skill-based.</p></div>

<p>This blog post presents the evaluation of the final VR locomotion technique. The goal of this user study was to better understand how the locomotion system performs when used by multiple users, focusing on performance, comfort, workload, presence, and enjoyment.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-study-design">1. Study Design</h2>
<p>To avoid bias from self-testing alone, a small-scale user study was conducted.</p>
<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 participants total</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 male, 1 female</li>
<li>Average age: <strong>25.3 years</strong></li>
<li>All participants had <strong>prior VR experience</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each participant completed the same locomotion task using the Rhythmic Skateboarding technique. Data from all three users (including the designer) were recorded and averaged.</p></div>

	<div class="entry__content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This blog post presents the final design and evaluation of a VR locomotion technique inspired by the core interaction of <strong>Angry Birds</strong>. The goal of this project was to explore an alternative, physics-inspired approach to locomotion that emphasizes direct manipulation, player agency, and playful experimentation.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I reflect on my experience as a student building and deploying my first blog using <strong>Hugo</strong> and <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. Although Hugo is a static site generator, the process taught me a lot about project structure, configuration, and deployment workflows.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-i-approached-this-task">How I Approached This Task</h2>
<p>I approached this task step by step. First, I focused on installing Hugo correctly and making sure it worked locally. After that, I created a new Hugo site and selected an existing theme instead of designing everything from scratch.</p></div>

<p>My goal was to set up <strong>Unity 6 (6000.0.60f1)</strong> and follow Unity’s beginner workflow to build a <strong>simple first 3D scene</strong>: a ground plane, a few objects, basic lighting, and a camera view that looks “game-like” when I press Play.</p>
<p>I treated it like a small checklist: <strong>install → create project → build scene → press Play → save</strong>.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I describe my experience implementing Unity’s official beginner tutorial <strong>Roll-a-Ball</strong>. The goal of the task is to build a small 3D game where the player controls a rolling ball, collects pickups, and tracks a score. This task helped me understand core Unity concepts such as physics, scripting, input, and UI.</p>

<p>I followed the tutorial step by step and focused on understanding <em>why</em> each component was added rather than only copying instructions. My workflow was:</p></div>

<p>After completing the classic <strong>Roll-a-Ball</strong> Unity tutorial, the next step was to upgrade the project into a <strong>VR</strong> experience.

	<div class="entry__content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I describe my implementation of locomotion technique. The idea originated from the game Angry Birds, where players can pull a slingshot in different directions and with different force to send birds flying in different trajectories to attack enemies. In my locomotion technique, the difference is player do not send birds flying anymore, instead, they send themselves. The goal of this project is to create an immersive and enjoyable VR experience.</p></div>
