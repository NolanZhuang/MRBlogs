## Introduction

This blog post presents the evaluation of the final VR locomotion technique. The goal of this user study was to better understand how the locomotion system performs when used by multiple users, focusing on performance, comfort, workload, presence, and enjoyment.

## 1. Study Design

To avoid bias from self-testing alone, a small-scale user study was conducted.

### Participants
- **3 participants total**
  - 2 male, 1 female  
  - Average age: **25.3 years**
  - All participants had **prior VR experience**

Each participant completed the same locomotion task using the Rhythmic Skateboarding technique. Data from all three users (including the designer) were recorded and averaged.

## 2. Dependent Variables

The evaluation followed the metrics specified in the assignment requirements.

### Objective Measures
- **Average time per round**  
- **Average accuracy per round**  
- **Average number of finished rounds**  

### Subjective Measures (Single-Item Scales)
All subjective measures used a **1–10 Likert scale** (1 = lowest, 10 = highest):

- **Motion Sickness**  
  *“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now?”*

- **Task Workload**  
  *“On a scale from 1 to 10, how easy was it to perform the task?”*

- **Presence**  
  *“On a scale from 1 to 10, how present did you feel in the virtual world?”*

- **Enjoyment**  
  *“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task?”*

## 3. Results

The following values represent averages across all three participants.

- **Average time per round:** **581 seconds**
- **Average accuracy per round:** **63.7 / 68**
- **Motion sickness:** **4**
- **Task workload:** **8.3**
- **Presence:** **7.7**
- **Enjoyment:** **7**

## 4. Discussion

### Performance
The relatively high accuracy score indicates that participants were generally able to understand and successfully interact with the locomotion mechanics. However, the long average completion time suggests that mastering the technique requires practice.

### Comfort
A motion sickness score of **4** indicates mild discomfort, which is relatively low for continuous locomotion systems. This suggests that head-directed steering and avoidance of sudden rotations help reduce simulator sickness.

### Workload
The task workload score (**8.3**) shows that participants found the system mentally and physically demanding. This aligns with the design intention: locomotion requires continuous attention, timing, and body movement.

### Presence and Enjoyment
Presence (**7.7**) and enjoyment (**7**) were both rated positively. Participants reported that the system felt immersive and engaging, even though it was challenging.

A common qualitative takeaway was:

> **“Enjoyable but quite hard to master.”**

Additionally, user performance was **strongly affected by the size and placement of interactive objects**, highlighting the importance of careful spatial design.

## 5. Conclusion

The evaluation shows that the Rhythmic Skateboarding locomotion technique:

- Provides an engaging and immersive VR movement experience  
- Keeps motion sickness at a relatively low level  
- Introduces a high but manageable workload  
- Rewards skill development and practice  

Future improvements could focus on:
- Adaptive difficulty  
- Clearer visual guidance  
- Refining marker size and placement to improve learnability
