				<div class="entry__content"><h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the scenario, the user starts in a <strong>ground view</strong> with the nearby environment visible. At some point, they want to see something far away, so they need to move to a <strong>sky view</strong> (a higher vantage point) to observe a larger area. A key constraint in this scenario is that <strong>the movement is passive</strong>: the system moves the user rather than the user actively walking/joysticking.</p>
<p>This is an interesting locomotion problem in VR because passive motion can easily increase discomfort and reduce spatial understanding. The slides propose three techniques to handle this “ground → sky” transition, each with different trade-offs.</p>
<p>A ground view may look like:</p>
<p><img src="ground.png" alt="Ground View"></p>
<p>A sky view may look like:</p>
<p><img src="sky.png" alt="Sky View"></p>

<h2 id="technique-1-suddenly-jump">Technique 1: Suddenly Jump</h2>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> No continuous motion is shown. The experience is segmented by fades.</p>
<p><strong>How it works (from the slides):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The ground view <strong>fades to black</strong>.</li>
<li>The view stays <strong>totally black</strong> briefly.</li>
<li>The black view <strong>fades back in</strong> to the sky view.</li>
<li>The user never sees motion between start and end (“No movement”).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why it might help:</strong><br>
Because the user does not visually experience motion, the visual-vestibular mismatch is reduced, which can improve comfort for some users.</p>
<p><strong>Main limitation:</strong><br>
The user loses all motion cues. This can weaken spatial awareness (e.g., “Where did I come from?”) and make the transition feel like a teleport cut.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="technique-2-bystander">Technique 2: Bystander</h2>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> The user remains stationary, but watches an <strong>avatar</strong> travel along the path first, so the system can “explain” the movement before switching viewpoints.</p>
<p><strong>How it works (from the slides):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The user stays in the ground view and watches an animation of an avatar (yellow capsule) moving along a trajectory (red line).</li>
<li>The avatar starts from the user’s position and travels to the end point.<br>
This implies: “you are the avatar and you will move along this trajectory.”</li>
<li>When the animation ends, the view <strong>fades to black</strong> and then <strong>fades in</strong> to the sky view (still “No movement” experienced by the user directly).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why it might help:</strong><br>
It provides <strong>path information</strong> (trajectory and direction) without forcing the user to visually experience continuous self-motion. This can preserve spatial understanding better than a pure jump.</p>
<p><strong>Main limitation:</strong><br>
The user still does not feel/see themselves moving. Also, the technique depends on users correctly interpreting the avatar as “me.”</p>
<p>The following image is a screen shot during Bystander method:</p>
<p><img src="bystander.png" alt="Bystander"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="technique-3-tunnel-vision">Technique 3: Tunnel Vision</h2>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Show continuous motion, but reduce discomfort by limiting motion to a smaller central area while keeping the periphery stable.</p>
<p><strong>How it works (from the slides):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The user experiences the movement from ground to sky.</li>
<li>A <strong>tunnel opens at the center</strong> of the view. The user can only see the motion inside this tunnel.</li>
<li>The <strong>outer part</strong> of the view stays static and continues showing the ground view.</li>
<li>When movement ends, the outer part of the tunnel <strong>fades out</strong>, revealing the full sky view.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why it might help:</strong><br>
This technique reduces motion sickness by stabilizing peripheral vision (a common comfort strategy). At the same time, it preserves some <strong>continuous motion cues</strong>, which can support orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Main limitation:</strong><br>
It can feel visually artificial, and it may reduce situational awareness during the transition because the user’s effective field of view is temporarily restricted.</p>
<p>The following image is a screen shot during Tunnel Vision method:</p>
<p><img src="tunnel.png" alt="Tunnel"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="evaluation-how-to-compare-the-techniques">Evaluation (How to Compare the Techniques)</h2>
<p>The slides propose evaluating these techniques with both objective and subjective measures.</p>
<h3 id="task-based-spatial-measure">Task-based spatial measure</h3>
<p>After the user reaches the end point (sky view), ask them to <strong>find out the start point</strong> (where they came from).<br>
This tests whether the locomotion method preserves the user’s spatial understanding of the environment and the path taken.</p>
<h3 id="objective-metric">Objective metric</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task completion time</strong>: how long it takes to identify/return to the start point (or indicate it correctly).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="subjective-metric">Subjective metric</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Questionnaire</strong>: collect comfort and preference feedback (e.g., nausea, dizziness, perceived control, clarity of movement).</li>
</ul>
