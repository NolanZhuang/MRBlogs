				<h1 class="entry__title">Lecture Homework 4: Final Presentation</h1>
				<div class="entry__content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This blog post presents the final design and evaluation of a VR locomotion technique inspired by the core interaction of <strong>Angry Birds</strong>. The goal of this project was to explore an alternative, physics-inspired approach to locomotion that emphasizes direct manipulation, player agency, and playful experimentation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-design-ideation-angry-birds-as-inspiration">1. Design Ideation: Angry Birds as Inspiration</h2>
<p>The initial idea for this locomotion system was inspired by the familiar <em>pull-and-release</em> mechanic from <strong>Angry Birds</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of traditional joystick-based movement, locomotion is driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stretching (pulling) an object</li>
<li>Releasing it to generate motion</li>
</ul>
<p>This metaphor was chosen because it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive and playful</li>
<li>Closely tied to physical action</li>
<li>Easy to understand without complex instructions</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-implementation-overview">2. Implementation Overview</h2>
<h3 id="interactive-objects">Interactive Objects</h3>
<p>Several interactive objects (white spheres) are placed throughout the scene. These objects act as locomotion anchors.</p>
<h3 id="locomotion-mechanics">Locomotion Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Players can <strong>grab and pull</strong> an object to build up speed</li>
<li><strong>Pulling distance</strong> determines the <em>magnitude</em> of the speed</li>
<li><strong>Head/gaze direction</strong> determines the <em>direction</em> of movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking upward beyond a certain angle allows <strong>diagonal upward movement</strong>, enabling jumping</li>
<li>While moving, if the player grabs another object, movement <strong>immediately stops</strong> next to it</li>
<li>When no interaction occurs, movement speed <strong>gradually decreases</strong>, preventing abrupt stops</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a locomotion system that blends physics-based motion with embodied interaction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-design-challenges">3. Design Challenges</h2>
<p>While the interaction was engaging, several challenges emerged during development.</p>
<h3 id="direction-mapping">Direction Mapping</h3>
<p>A major design question was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the movement direction follow the <strong>pull direction</strong>, or the <strong>player’s viewing direction</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Using gaze direction improved spatial awareness but also increased cognitive load.</p>
<h3 id="control-difficulty">Control Difficulty</h3>
<p>Participants reported that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system was <strong>very hard to control</strong>, especially for precise navigation</li>
<li>Small differences in pulling distance or object placement had large effects on movement</li>
</ul>
<p>These challenges highlight the trade-off between expressive control and usability.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-evaluation-method">4. Evaluation Method</h2>
<p>A small user study was conducted to evaluate the system with multiple users.</p>
<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 participants</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 male, 1 female</li>
<li>Average age: <strong>25.3 years</strong></li>
<li>All had prior VR experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each participant completed the same task using the locomotion technique, and results were averaged.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-results">5. Results</h2>
<h3 id="objective-metrics">Objective Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average time per round:</strong> <strong>581 seconds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average accuracy per round:</strong> <strong>63.7 / 68</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="subjective-metrics-110-scale">Subjective Metrics (1–10 scale)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion sickness:</strong> <strong>4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task workload:</strong> <strong>8.3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Presence:</strong> <strong>7.7</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> <strong>7</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-discussion">6. Discussion</h2>
<p>The results suggest a clear pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low motion sickness</strong> indicates that gradual acceleration and deceleration helped maintain comfort</li>
<li><strong>High workload</strong> reflects the system’s demand for precision and continuous attention</li>
<li><strong>Strong presence and enjoyment</strong> show that players felt immersed and engaged despite the difficulty</li>
</ul>
<p>A consistent qualitative takeaway was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Enjoyable but quite hard to master.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance was also <strong>strongly influenced by the size and placement of interactive objects</strong>, emphasizing how critical spatial layout is in object-driven locomotion systems.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-conclusion-and-future-work">7. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
<p>This Angry Birds–inspired locomotion technique demonstrates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physics-based, object-driven movement can be highly engaging</li>
<li>Increased player agency often comes with higher cognitive and physical demands</li>
<li>Careful tuning is essential to balance expressiveness and control</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential future improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive scaling of pulling strength</li>
<li>Visual previews of movement trajectories</li>
<li>Improved object placement and spacing guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this project shows that unconventional locomotion metaphors can offer compelling alternatives to standard VR movement techniques—especially when exploration and playfulness are key design goals.</p>
